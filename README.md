**TourGuide** is a script meant to help [Kingdom of Loathing](https://www.kingdomofloathing.com/) players efficiently play through an ascension. It will give you advice on getting through your active quests, tips on how to efficiently using your resources, and reminders on using time-limited resources. 

To install, run the following command on an up-to-date [KolMafia](https://github.com/kolmafia/kolmafia) version:

> `git checkout loathers/tourguide release`

To update, run `git update` or check the "Update installed Git projects on login" box within Mafia preferences.

## Running TourGuide
Once TourGuide is installed, look at the top bar within your relay browser. In the upper right, underneath the moon state and the bug report button, there will be a drop-down menu. Select TourGuide from this menu, and the script will dock to the right side of your window.

## Using TourGuide
At its core, TourGuide is like Clippy, Microsoft's wildly unsuccessful advice daemon from Microsoft Word 1997. You can use it as actively or as minimally as you want. TourGuide aims to inform you of the many resources a KoL player has -- things like free runaways, banishes, free kills, et cetera -- and give you ideas on what to use them on. TourGuide aims to give users a heads up on the many arcane speedster strats used to complete ascensions in the minimum possible turns. KoL is a complicated game, and TourGuide is the little parrot that sits on your shoulder and pecks at you to remind you not to lose track of your resources. 

Some people use TourGuide on every quest, referring back to it like a treasured family accountant. Others open it at the end of a KoL day to see what resources they may have forgotten to use. Others still use it, but minimize every tab except for Guzzlr, because they love Guzzlr so much that the entire game is just endless Guzzlr parties. There are many ways to use TourGuide.
