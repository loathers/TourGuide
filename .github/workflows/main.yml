name: bundle ASH script(s), and push to new branch
# By https://github.com/fredg1

# USER MANUAL
#  This workflow should run by itself without the need for any change.
#  It's, however, currently tailored to TourGuide.
#  If you wish to change its behavior (change the name of the target branch, where it places the result in it, or if you wish to use it on a folder + script other than Source + relay/TourGuide.ash), all you need to modify should be in the "env" section down below.
# I'm working on making this its own action that can be called as many times as needed, on any script, with as much customization as possible, but github is still not done on the feature I'd need for that :/

env:
  # Branch to checkout under ./target_branch/ . If contains {0}, {0} will be replaced by the source branch's name.
  # (doesn't need to be the name of an existing branch. Will create one if needed (will be a copy of the source branch))
  # examples: 'Pre-Release', 'Bundled-{0}', 'my_{0}_2.0' or just '{0}' (not the best idea, though...)
  TARGET_NAME: 'Bundled-{0}'
  
  
  
  # The path to take (folders to go through) to reach the "mafia folder" in both branches.
  # RELATIVE paths only (relative to the root of the repository).
  # Empty string if it is reachable from the root.
  
  # Only its content will be transferred to <target_branch>
  SOURCE_PATH_TO_MAFIA: 'Source'
  
  # If this folder already exists on the target branch, IT'S PREVIOUS CONTENT WILL BE ERASED.
  # Stuff outside of it won't.
  TARGET_PATH_TO_MAFIA: ''
  
  
  
  # comma-separated list of (relative) path and name of the ASH scripts you want to bundle, and their new names and (relative) destinations.
  # Paths need to be relative to the "mafia folder".
  # Any .ash script not in this list won't be transferred, so if you have scripts that don't have imports, but want them in the result, include them here anyway
  
  # The scripts to bundle
  ASH_SCRIPT_SOURCES: 'relay/relay_TourGuide.ash'
  # Their (RESPECTIVE; order matters) destinations
  ASH_SCRIPT_DESTINATIONS: 'relay/relay_TourGuide.ash'
